# Lucid-Nightmares-Level

This is a level I created as part of a first year game project. The game was planned to be a 2d platformer, and this level is set in a dark underground cave where the objective is to acquire a key which you need to bring back to the central area of the game which you have just warped from. The central area and other levels of the game were not merged together in time for the submission date so this is just a singular level. 

Contains traps, ghosts, zombies and a boss fight!
